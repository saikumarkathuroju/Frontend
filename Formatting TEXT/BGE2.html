       <p>The word learning is used routinely in discussions about teaching in higher education, so itâ€™s important to clarify</p> what we are referring to when we talk about learning. Educational researchers agree that <br>learning is much deeper than memorization and information recall. Deep and long-lasting learning involves understanding, relating ideas and making connections between prior and new knowledge, independent and critical thinking and ability to transfer knowledge to new and different contexts.
