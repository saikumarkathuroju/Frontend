        <h6>Geographical distribution</h6>
        <p>Since 2001, there has been a significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by the rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.</p>
        <h2>Business Leders</h2> 
        <p>Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions.[6] A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.</p>
